# SBA-front-end

This site is similar to the pokeTEK example, a site that allows for searching of information in the api
at mhw-db.com

You can search for equipment or monsters that are in Monster Hunter World or in Monster Hunter World Iceborne.
The searches take advantage of wildcard queries so you don't need to enter the full name of anything you are
looking for - the search rath for monsters will bring up all Rathalos/Rathian variants.

There is also a little monster guessing game for people who are familiar with Monster Hunter World
